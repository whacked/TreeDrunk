* TreeDrunk: to create parsers for markup renderers using TreeTop

  - I cannot think of a good name so I don't! care,

* Please support my org-markup mister github,

Currently it seems like [[http://github.com/bdewey/org-ruby][org-ruby]] is *the* way to render org-mode documents from ruby (see [[http://github.com/github/gollum][gollum]]), but org-ruby's support of org-markup is incomplete.

In interest of writing as little code as possible and hopefully, easily allowing markup rendering support for [[http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html][EmacsMuse]] markup, TreeDrunk uses [[http://treetop.rubyforge.org/][TreeTop]] to create a parser factory. Then you feed it into a renderer factory, or something.

*** IZ IN UR GITHUB TESTING UR MARKUPZ

it is shown that orgmode does indeed render on github. However, we expect a horizontal rule here:

-----

do we get a horizontal rule?
