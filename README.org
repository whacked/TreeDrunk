* TreeDrunk: to create parsers for markup renderers using TreeTop

  - I cannot think of a good name so I don't! care,

* Please support my org-markup mister github,

Currently it seems like [[http://github.com/bdewey/org-ruby][org-ruby]] is *the* way to render org-mode documents from ruby (see [[http://github.com/github/gollum][gollum]]), but org-ruby's support of org-markup is incomplete.

In interest of writing as little code as possible and hopefully, easily allowing markup rendering support for [[http://mwolson.org/projects/EmacsMuse.html][EmacsMuse]] markup, TreeDrunk uses [[http://treetop.rubyforge.org/][TreeTop]] to create a parser factory. Then you feed it into a renderer factory, or something.

*** IZ IN UR GITHUB TESTING UR MARKUPZ

it is shown that orgmode does indeed render on github. However, we expect a horizontal rule here:

-----

do we get a horizontal rule?

Not as of this commit, whichever working branch of org-ruby is in use here.

* Current markup elements supported by this parser:

headings (levels 1~6 become h1~h6, beyond that reverts to span)

bold

underline

italic

code

verbatim

horizontal rule

hyperlink

* Unsupported markup elements:

lists

* Anything beyond markup is unsupported!

like drawers, code blocks, todo lists, and everything else

* Dependencies

treetop rubygem

* Usage

see [[test.rb]]; =ruby test.rb= will output a converted html sample
